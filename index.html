            I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the
            iphones i have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a
            great man and a awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day
            and go for and work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to
            own Apple and follow by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than
            before it was. But i will dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man
            and I will never forget him.

            What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've
            written as an adult (and certainly every one that has been
            published), almost every email I've ever written, has been written
            on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple
            machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to
            realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid And through his
            vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr.
            Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work

            using Apple products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple.
            And, of course, I've been always admiring your products. And for me
            everything in Apple is connected with Steve. I do hope he'll be
